For A Good Cause

Description:
Break up into groups of 3-6. Then, choose a cause that your group really cares about and put together a small informational website using HTML/CSS trying to convince people to donate to or help out this cause. This site should have at least as many pages as there are group members (with a minimum of 3) and look as professional as possible using modern design trends. Research similar websites to get inspiration.

Then each member should take a page and illustrate the DOM tree as a graph. Each member should also create a data structure similar to an adjacency list which lists each element in the Dom and its attributes (does it have parents, siblings, children, how many edges connect to the node and leave the node and possibly other attributes).
The main goal of the project is to work as a group to create a website that will be hosted on GitHub pages.

Once you have decided on a cause, begin by selecting one teammate to create a Git repo with an index.html file, push it to GitHub, then add the other teammates as collaborators on the repo. Throughout this project each teammate should be communicating often and using GitHub effectively. Remember no one should be working off Master so create branches, resolve merge conflicts, and create and close issues.
